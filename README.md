My Personal Site
===================
_(in progress)_

Finally, I mustered up the courage to rewrite it from the currently obsolete [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) framework to modern
[React](https://reactjs.org/). It was not easy to come up with a design, as always, do not judge strictly :)

**Used:** [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [MUI](https://mui.com/)
